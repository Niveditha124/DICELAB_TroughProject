# DICELAB_TroughProject
MATLAB-Python conversion of trough formation simulation [Earth-Mars]
* Please use fork-and-branch workflow

Comments
1. geoturbid1D is the driver code file
2. initMonterray as input file for base optimal results in MATLAB
3. have been using init1D to test conversion in Python -- any input file will work though


To do: 
  line 78 (np.array drama)
  Hyperbolic (index issues)
  Relax: friction, entrainment, knappBagnold, dissipation, hemipelagic
